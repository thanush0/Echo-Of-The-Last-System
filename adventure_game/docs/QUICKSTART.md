## Your First Quest

**"Find the System Core Fragment"**

Objectives:
1. Explore the Forgotten Ruins (5 times)
2. Defeat a Corrupted Guardian
3. Obtain the Core Fragment

This quest may glitch. That's intentional.

## Survival Tips

1. **Save often** - System glitches can be deadly
2. **Analyze new enemies** - Learn their weaknesses
3. **Balance corruption** - Too high or too low affects endings
4. **Listen to the Oracle** - They know your true name
5. **Read all lore** - It explains what happened
6. **Try different choices** - There are 5+ endings

## Multiple Endings Preview

Play differently each time to discover all endings:

- **Survival** - Just stay alive
- **System Takeover** - Embrace the glitches
- **World Collapse** - Break everything
- **Freedom** - Destroy the System
- **True Ending** - Balance is key (hardest to get)

## Combat Tips

### Against Corrupted Slime
- Weak enemy, good for practice
- Use basic attacks
- Low reward but safe

### Against Ruins Skeleton
- Medium difficulty
- May drop Memory Shards
- Analyze to learn about the past

### Against Glitched Wolf
- Fast and dangerous
- High agility needed to flee
- Can phase mid-combat

### Against Corrupted Guardian (Boss)
- Very strong - level up first!
- Drops System Core Fragment
- Required for most endings
- Can randomly appear at exploration count 10+

## Skills You Can Unlock

- **Void Strike** - High damage, costs MP
- **System Hack** - Weaken enemies
- **Reality Tear** - Intelligence-based attack

Most forbidden skills unlock through system glitches!

## When Things Glitch

System glitches are **FEATURES**, not bugs:

- Quests may mutate or fail
- NPCs remember your choices
- Reality can shift unexpectedly

## Save System

3 save slots available:
- Saves your entire game state

## Story Hints (No Major Spoilers)

- You are User #10,392
- 10,391 others came before you
- All of them failed
- The System wants to keep you trapped
- The Oracle knows your real name
- This world ended long ago
- You might be the key to breaking the cycle

## Final Tips

1. **First playthrough:** Just explore and survive
2. **Second playthrough:** Try to find the Oracle early

4. **Fourth playthrough:** Stay pure (low corruption)
